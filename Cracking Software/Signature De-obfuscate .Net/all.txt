Antidote:
Set bpx on gchandle.free, and dump koi.exe






Anti Tamper:
Signature:
An exception occurred when decompiling this method (06000005)
or,
empty functions.

EntryPoint VirtualProtect in cctor. Also same with Anti-Dump protection, but, Anti-Dump has visible
contents within functions.
Antidote: set bpx on module static. and step over, then dump koi. If there is no koi, then you shoud
dump the exe. Reopen the exe in dnSpy. You can now see the contents of the functions. To be able to
run it, NOP the static module and dump the exe. Run this new exe.






Constants Protection:
Signature:
You can see the Form and the functions. But the parameters of the function calls are obfuscated. In
Name Protection, you can't even see the Form.
Antidote:
Use UnconfuserEX Tool: ConfuserExConstantDecryptor






Control Flow Protection
Signature:
cctor static module blank but btn-click-handler has for(;;) and switch-case
Antidote: ConfuserExSwitchKiller






Anti Dump Protection:

except for the PE header.
Antidote: bpx on module static, don't step over, dump.





Reference Proxy Protection:
Signature:
Form methods are obfuscated
Antidote: ConfuserExCallFixer:

You can nop the static module and dump and the dump should work with the new resource.





Name Protection:
Signature:
All names/strings everywhere are obfuscated \uxxxx
In Constants Protection, you can see the Form and the functions. But the parameters of the function calls
are obfuscated. In Name Protection, you can't even see the Form

Antidote:

(dnSpy takes care of them automatically)
Anti IL Dasm
Anti Debug Protection
